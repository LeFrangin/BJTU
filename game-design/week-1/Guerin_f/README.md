## Game

The game I choose for this week is the tic tac toe. This is a simple and easy game to play but really famous and i like it very much :)

## Goal

Each players choose their sign. By default we have cross and circle.
The goal of this game is to be the **first who gets 3 of his sign in a row**

If one player gets it, 3 sign in a row, the game is finished and the player won, even if some squares still empty. 
If all square are taken and none of two players have 3 sign in a row, then it's a draw

You can win if :
- You have 3 signs in a row on the vertical line
- You have 3 signs in a row on the horizontal line
- You have 3 signs in a row on the diagonal line

## Rules

- The grid is 3x3. So we can have 9 squares. You can only put one sign on one square.
- Players have to define their square before the game. When the game start, players can't change their sign until the next game.
- Players are playing turn by turn.
- Players can only use their own sign.
- Players can only put one sign by turn.
- Players have to put a sign onto the grid, on one of 9 squares.
- Players have to play in a free square, they can't put their sign onto a square already taken.
- Players can't taken a sign back after they had put it on the grid.
